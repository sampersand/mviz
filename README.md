# The `p` command
A program to escape "weird" characters in strings or files.

`p` is essentially a replacement for interactive use of `echo` or `cat`: Instead of `echo "$variable"` or `cat file.txt`, which would be hiding invisible characters (like `\x01`), instead do `p "$variable"` or `p -f file.txt`.

# Examples
`p` is designed with sensible defaults in mind; its default behaviour is what you want most of the time, but it can easily (and sensibly) be changed with options

```sh
$ p "$variable"        # See the contents of a shell variable
$ p -d "$variable"     # Delete weird characters from the variable
$ p -f some-file.txt   # Print some-file, escaping all characters
$ p -fw some-file.txt  # Like the previous line, but newlines and tabs aren't escaped.
$ some_command | p     # Visualize weird chars of `some_command`
$ some_command | p -l  # Like the previous one, but don't escape newlines.
$ some_command | p -b  # Interpret input data as binary, not utf-8 (the default)
```
It's also quite useful when you're learning how shells work:
```bash
# See what files are expanded by a glob
$ p [A-Z]*
    1: LICENSE
    2: README.md
# See how `$variable` word splits
$ variable='hello    world,   :-)'
$ p $variable
    1: hello
    2: world,
    3: :-)
# See how `$IFS` affects it
$ IFS=o
$ p $variable
    1: hell
    2:     w
    3: rld,   :-)
```

Try `p -h` for short usage, and `p --help` for the longer one.

# Why not use tool X (`xxd`, `hexdmp`, `vis`, `od`, etc)?
The biggest difference between `p` and other tools is that `p` is intended for looking at text (not binary data) by default, and optimizes for that. (It doesn't change the output _unless_ weird characters exist.) For example:
```bash
% printf 'hello\x04world, how are you? \xC3üëç\n' | p
hello\x04world, how are you? \xC3üëç\n

% printf 'hello\x04world, how are you? \xC3üëç\n' | xxd

00000020

% printf 'hello\x04world, how are you? \xC3üëç\n' | od -c
0000000    h   e   l   l   o 004   w   o   r   l   d   ,       h   o   w
0000020        a   r   e       y   o   u   ?     303  üëç  **  **  **  \n
0000040

% printf 'hello\x04world, how are you? \xC3üëç\n' | vis
hello\^Dworld, how are you? \M-C\M-p\M^_\M^Q\M^M

% printf 'hello\x04world, how are you? \xC3üëç\n' | cat -v
hello^Dworld, how are you? ??M-^_M-^QM-^M
```

# Encodings

# How it works
The way `p` works at a high-level is pretty easy: Every character in an input is checked against the list of escapes. If it matches, the first escape that matches is used. Otherwise, the char is printed verbatim. In list form:

1. Is the byte/character illegal in the given encoding (eg byte `0xC3` in UTF-8)? If so, print the escape.


# Charsets

## TODO
- Should I add an `--highlight-means-error` flag (name subject to bikeshed)? I.e. if there's _any_ form of highlights, return an error. (done)
- Should make `-l` not `--unescape='\n'` but instead act like `/\R/` (ie platform-indep line sep)?
- `p -ax` makes everything hex, except for spaces and backslashes. should we do this?
- MAke `escape-options.txt` the actual escape options that are used. E.g., right now, it's not possible to have spaces escaped as `\x20`, but still have utf-8 chars escaped as `\u`

## Character class
- There's a 

Oops:
```sh
print '\xC3üëç' | p --escape='\u{1F44D}' --escape='\xC3'
```
This isn't great, cause regexes can't be one or the other. so i have to figure out what to do...

You can also `LC_ALL=en_US-iso8859-1"

# HOW ESCAPES WORK
If a character is to be escaped, it goes through the following steps:
1. If `--delete` is given, nothing is printed
2. If `--dot` is given, a `.` is used

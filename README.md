# The `p` command
A program to visualize invisible and invalid bytes in different encodings.

`p` is essentially a replacement for interactive use of `echo` or `cat`: Instead of `echo "$variable"` or `cat file.txt`, which (on most terminals) hide invisible characters (like `\x01`), you instead do `p "$variable"` or `p -f file.txt`.

# Examples
`p` is designed with sensible defaults in mind; its default behaviour is what you want most of the time, but it can easily (and sensibly) be changed with options

```sh
$ p "$variable"        # See the contents of a shell variable
$ p -d "$variable"     # Delete weird characters from the variable
$ p -f file.txt        # Print file.txt, escaping "weird" characters
$ p -fw file.txt       # Like the previous line, but newlines and tabs aren't escaped.
$ some_command | p     # Visualize weird characters of `some_command`
$ some_command | p -l  # Like the previous one, but don't escape newlines.
$ some_command | p -b  # Interpret input data as binary, not UTF-8 (the default)
```

It's also quite useful when you're learning how shells work:
```bash
# See what files are expanded by a glob
$ p [A-Z]*
    1: LICENSE
    2: README.md
# See how `$variable` word splits
$ variable='hello    world,   :-)'
$ p $variable
    1: hello
    2: world,
    3: :-)
# See how `$IFS` affects it
$ IFS=o
$ p $variable
    1: hell
    2:     w
    3: rld,   :-)
```

Try `p -h` for short usage, and `p --help` for the longer one.

# Why not use tool X (`xxd`, `hexdmp`, `vis`, `od`, etc)?
The biggest difference between `p` and other tools is that `p` is intended for looking at mostly-normal text by default, and optimizes for that. It doesn't change the output _unless_ weird characters exist. For example:
```bash
% printf 'hello\x04world, how are you? \xC3üëç\n' | p
hello\x04world, how are you? \xC3üëç\n

% printf 'hello\x04world, how are you? \xC3üëç\n' | xxd
00000000: 6865 6c6c 6f04 776f 726c 642c 2068 6f77  hello.world, how

% printf 'hello\x04world, how are you? \xC3üëç\n' | hexdump -C

00000010  20 61 72 65 20 79 6f 75  3f 20 c3 f0 9f 91 8d 0a  | are you? ......|
00000020

% printf 'hello\x04world, how are you? \xC3üëç\n' | od -c
0000000    h   e   l   l   o 004   w   o   r   l   d   ,       h   o   w
0000020        a   r   e       y   o   u   ?     303  üëç  **  **  **  \n
0000040

% printf 'hello\x04world, how are you? \xC3üëç\n' | vis
hello\^Dworld, how are you? \M-C\M-p\M^_\M^Q\M^M

% printf 'hello\x04world, how are you? \xC3üëç\n' | cat -v
hello^Dworld, how are you? ??M-^_M-^QM-^M
```

In addition, `p` by default adds a "standout marker" to escaped characters (by default, it inverts the foreground and background colours), so they're more easily distinguished at a glance.

# How it works
The way `p` works at a high-level is pretty easy: Every character in an input is checked against the list of patterns, and the first one that matches is used. If no patterns match, the character is checked against the "default pattern," and if that doesn't match, the character is printed verbatim.

To simplify the most common use-case of `p`, where only the "escaping mechanism" (called an "ACTION"; see below) is changed, a lot of short-hand flags (such as `-x`, `-d`, etc.) are provided to just change the default action.

`p` is broken into three configurable parts: The encoding of the input data, the "charsets" to match against the input data, and the ac

# How it works
1. Is the byte/character illegal in the given encoding (eg byte `0xC3` in UTF-8)? If so, print the escape.


# Charsets

## TODO
- Should I add an `--highlight-means-error` flag (name subject to bikeshed)? I.e. if there's _any_ form of highlights, return an error. (done)
- Should make `-l` not `--unescape='\n'` but instead act like `/\R/` (ie platform-indep line sep)?
- `p -ax` makes everything hex, except for spaces and backslashes. should we do this?
- MAke `escape-options.txt` the actual escape options that are used. E.g., right now, it's not possible to have spaces escaped as `\x20`, but still have utf-8 chars escaped as `\u`

## Character class

Oops:
```sh
print '\xC3üëç' | p --escape='\u{1F44D}' --escape='\xC3'
```
This isn't great, cause regexes can't be one or the other. so i have to figure out what to do...

# HOW ESCAPES WORK
If a character is to be escaped, it goes through the following steps:
1. If `--delete` is given, nothing is printed
2. If `--dot` is given, a `.` is used
